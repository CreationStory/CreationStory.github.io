19 And if any man do away of the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away the part of him from the book of life, and from the holy city, and from these things that be written in this book.

20 He saith, that beareth witnessing of these things, Yea, Amen. Lo! I come soon. Amen. Come thou, Lord Jesus.

21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
