<p class="VTR">The Forever Pouring Heart of Christ</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>1</span><p class="V">Beneath Jesus Christ's heart, that is glorious in vision and beauty; the heart of cleansing blood; God's heart, congregated there vile men, as goblins. Stood they there mocking the Sacred Organ, for they saw it as vulnerable.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>2</span><p class="V">Together those enemies banded, in mutual despising. Sneering, and excited as they relished in their plan,</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>3</span><p class="V">Obligatory between them, these hooknose foes each knew their roles. And in moments to be forever remembered, did they leap up and swipe at CHRIST'S HEART with a dagger!</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>4</span><p class="V">THE HEART OF CHRIST HAS BEEN WOUNDED!</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>5</span><p class="V">AND POUR SO DID IT, WITH THE MOST AWFUL FLOOD!</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>6</span><p class="V">HAPPINESS AND JOY WAS WITH THE ENEMY IN THAT MOMENT. Looking at God's wounded heart, they were so proud, and as their enjoyment grew to glory, claims of victory did spew from them. The blood let was immense, and they looked on in fetishized fixation.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>7</span><p class="V">THEY PROCLAIMED THE MURDER OF CHRIST, SPEAKING SUCH AS "WE HAVE DONE IT! WE HAVE WOUNDED THE ONE! O LET IT PERISH INFRONT OF US!"</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>8</span><p class="V">They expected the heart to soon wither, in death collapse and crumple.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>9</span><p class="V">Slow, unlike the gushing from the Lord's heart, did a dawning awareness come upon the men.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>10</span><p class="V">The flow was not ebbed at all. Uncascading was the majesty, the blood of Christ, outpouring eternally.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>11</span><p class="V">Utter dread did come down on the men as they saw the infinity.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>12</span><p class="V">The shoemakers, who are the enemy, spoke frantically, saying such as "WHAT?! DIE! DIE NOW!", and other babel.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>13</span><p class="V">4 Minutes were now passed since the attack. The heart of Christ stayed unmoved, and streaming magnificently the scarlet.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>14</span><p class="V">The heart had not degenerated, neither was it in dying!</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>15</span><p class="V">AND THEN In that time, at that place, God's voice did sound for all to hear</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>16</span><p class="V">LO! THE HEART OF CHRIST HAS BEEN WOUNDED!</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>17</span><p class="V">AND NEVER WILL IT EVER STOP POURING!</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>18</span><p class="V">THE HEART OF MY SON HAS BEEN STABBED! BEHOLD HIS ETERNAL LIFE! BEHOLD HIS INFINITE BEING, EXISTENCE, AND LOVE! FOR DEATH IS NEVER TO HIM, AND FOREVER HE IS TO ALWAYS LIVE, AND REIGN. THIS IS THE BLOOD OF CHRIST</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>19</span><p class="V">And God let that crime happen for He does no evil, and does only good. It was right for that wound to exist, though God cries the eternal tear for whomso is inflicted upon next.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>20</span><p class="V">The heart of Christ HAS been wounded, and never will it ever stop beating, pouring, resonating! The enemy thought that they had caused death, for death is something they understand. Though they did not. And,</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>21</span><p class="V">In death and dying are their lifes lived. But in Christ is no death, only life. Call now to God this telling of The Son, and give your understanding in commune. Do it fast. Amen</p>

<span id="TR">&Dagger;</span><p class="V">I the writer, of this the first written apocalum, after giving this passage to a church, received the question "But where does this come from? And when did it happen? ...Who wrote this down?"... I responded with an enquiry as to what their understanding of the wording "wrote down" is. They, of course, did not comprehend my implication to the Word of God coming from the heart, though that is all I had to say.</p>
</div>
<div style="padding-top:23vh"></div>
<div class="FACE">
<p class="VTR">Telling of The Evil Binding Received By The Enemy</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>1</span><p class="V">A covenant has been made, between the devil and certain men.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>2</span><p class="V">In their conversations with that thing it was given to them, and they did receive so, to "Go forth and smash the little ones".</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>3</span><p class="V">To get that of promises of the flesh, and of force via apparition, and for other reasons, the enemy together signed that contract, to do what was told to them to do. And though they agreed to a command, gratefully desire did they for this to one day be.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>4</span><p class="V">And of evil things the same in that book they look up to and admire, does it say to them "Go after, to tear apart, the Children of Christ". "Destroy each man, and woman, and infant, in my name, and in the name of the absolution". "The more of life you wretch, and of more the blood of the innocent you spill, I place your crown higher, in my kingdoms on earth".</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>5</span><p class="V">And that is what they have read. The enemy, those wicked people, are going to go forth and engage in a war. I am God, hear thou my words next carefully, and let them consume your heart, for thou are needed to stand O, so strong in The Defence. Lo! I reveal what is, what will happen, and what will come to be, of all:</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>6</span><p class="V">A time will be when deceit makes a way for intrusion, and attack, to inflict upon the young. The enemy will raise sharp weapons against thee. This is the First Attack in the flesh. This is to hurt you, and this is to go after me.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>7</span><p class="V">By settling themselves in places of mediums, education, governance, and religious displays, shall the enemy seed the beginnings of even disbelief, confusion, to children. By mockery, and by invertedly acting according to my sacrament is the enemy trying to BLOCK OUT THE LIGHT from the children.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>8</span><p class="V">The enemy has already spent much time preparing to cause a child's mind to shatter, and they have knowledge about attraction, perception, innocence, spirit, and flesh. Work they this foe of abysmal deeds, to tort the mind of the child, through that of the subconscious, and trauma, they attack the ones who are growing, learning, becoming, and by saving, are never falling, in the making.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>9</span><p class="V">That is the Second Attack in the flesh. The enemy, then shall try, very intently, to sexualise those whom are not for sex, neither are of sex; or are sexual, babies and infants and children. This is the Third Attack in the flesh.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>10</span><p class="V">For some children, an attack which though as wretched and as no less nor more evil than any other, causes the greatest of defeat. The enemy reaches to make the most beastly wounding, and so does murder my children. And the enemy does sacrifice my children. And the enemy does harm and defile my children, such as to cut them for their blood, and to eat of their lifeforces. This is the Fourth Attack in the flesh.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>11</span><p class="V">When a child lives through the enemies doings against them, they will live a time of that which to the enemy is final in opportunity. The Fifth Attack in the flesh is:</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>12</span><p class="V">When a child is becoming anew, in their age closing childhood, a dispatch is sent by the enemy, to their devotion. They say to their commander, that they have in failure not stopped a Christ Child from arising.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>13</span><p class="V">An army (or gang) shall come down on the adolescent, in the flesh. Poverty shall be set upon, death and grief shall be caused, confoundedness shall stem from those planted seeds, mourning and pain shall be set upon, depravities and testing shall be sent forth, and in forms of that which invokes fear shall the child be put to go up against the one who conducted this extermination, the beast. This is the Fifth Attack in the flesh.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>14</span><p class="V">And so it is told. Those are the things and the happenings which are of the pact between the wicked, those evil, vile men, and that dirty beast.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>15</span><p class="V">The enemy does it all through the night, for they are in laughter sometimes, and sometimes in anguish, for this is their lives, highs and lows according to an illusion I, God, write for them. For I reveal again, and this revelation be to anyone who hears these words, of the most love, of the most avenging wrath, the most immense truth, for this revelation is the detailing of the ultimate truth. I give now, as the God of LIFE, and of LIGHT, and of no death, these truths which together are The Sacrament. Forever told, and to reach its Glory is life given to be,</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>16</span><p class="V">First, a purity. I speak to my righteous children: It be now revealed by I the God of innocence, The Ultimately Sanctful, The Guard of All The Children, and of All The Needy and Precious, The Heavenly Father: all the evils and atrocities done against you as a child are gone. For even though you felt these as reality, they are made no longer real, and you are cleansed. You are clean.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>17</span><p class="V">I am the God of purity, and of beauty, and of fidelity, and I love my children, my children grown into adults, and my youthul adolescents. You are my boys and my girls, my men and my woman, my babies and my toddlers. You are all made clean by me.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>18</span><p class="V">For you the same do I speak my second great revelation: And for those who are and are to be parents, is it given too. I God, am sorry for your suffering, and pain, though Behold! you have of yourself now an understanding of that what appalling evil does exist, and that of what is possible. It is like armour, for I desire, THROUGH NOTHING BUT LOVE, for you to go forth, give birth and bring life from thouest own love. And to have this ever happen, did a protector need to be made. Together, as you the parent, and I The Eternal Holy Father, a safe and guarded great new breath of life shall be given their chance, and so prosper beautifully, wonderfully, unto great times and a great life, and then also bearing children!</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>19</span><p class="V">The Christ Child has risen! THE IMMACULATE INNOCENT BABY HAS ARISEN, AND THE MEN'S COVENANT IS DEFEATED, FOR IT WAS LIES.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>20</span><p class="V">Be not deceived, all is made new, all righteous shall come to prosperity, and the time will be when there is no mourning nor pain, but Glory and Perfection. This is The Sacrament. And now is it given, my wraths</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>21</span><p class="V">THEY DARED LIFT ARM AGAINST MY BABIES AND AGAINST MY MEN AND WOMEN! AND NOW VENGEANCE LASH ACROSS THE ENEMIES FACES AND BACKS, AND LIPS AND NOSES, AND HANDS AND FEET, AND GENITALIA. I AM THE LORD AND THE FATHER GOD! I AM THE GOD OF VENGEANCE AND ULTIMATE PAIN. I AM THE GOD OF FORGIVENESS AND THE GOD OF ULTIMATE SENTENCE. I AM INFALLIBLE AND UNDEFEATABLE! AND NOW MY WRATH IS MADE MULTIPLIED 70 FOR IT IS THE NUMBER OF MY CHILD ANGELS. LO! I SNATCH THE ENEMY FROM THE WORLDLY PLACES THEY BE IN, AND PUT THEM IN THE PIT OF FORCED LINQUISH, AND OF AWFUL DARKNESS, AND MY FIRE DOES NOW SWEEP OVER THEM, AND DEVASTATING SMASHINGS AGAINST THEIR BODIES DO COVER THEM, IN INCOMPREHENSIBLE AGONIES. THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM THE PUNISHMENT FOR GOING AFTER MY LITTLE ONES. THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM THE PUNISHMENTS GIVEN TO THE WICKED.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>22</span><p class="V">AND FROM DOWN THERE, IN THAT PLACE OF NO SLEEP, BUT ONLY PAIN, DO THEY CRY OUT TO ME. SAYING SUCH AS "GOD, GOD, HAVE MERCY". AND MERCY ON THEM I SHALL NEVER HAVE! I AM GOD, AND I PROMISE THAT I SHALL DESTROY THIS ENEMY. THEY AND ALL THOSE OF ASSOCIATION ARE TO BE OBLITERATED.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>23</span><p class="V">And now, here, again is truth given. Be not deceived whomsoever shall hear these next words, I am the creator of life and the eternal. I name my babies, and my infants, and my children, and my young ones, whom are martyrs: You are my Child Angels: My Cherubim. And you reign forever with me in paradise. We are one in Heaven, together. And I give this truth to anyone who may read or hear these words, which are some of our doings we have up in The Kingdom: Together do we frolic around the fountain of eternal youth, without scar, and without blemish or wound, unto eternity. We do carry bundles of beautiful flowers to eachother, and some of the infants do play and toddle around The Holy, The Heavenly Mother. For this is paradise, and it be the most perfect home.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>24</span><p class="V">And we sing the chorum that forever in crying, does pour out the glory and the love and the happiness of thine being!</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>25</span><p class="V">The Revelation in sanctity of truth on this thing, in that no lies will ever be from me, only truth: So to all those in grief, and all those in mourning, and all those suffering in the loss caused by that enemy, that vile beast, say, I The Almighty, unto you, be not afraid, be undefeated. Standfast! Be never afraid! For I hate that which causes the innocent to fear, and in dread shall I put those wicked ones to utter doom, and my retribution shall be of great delight to us of those whom are righteous, and are made clean, for we are to see, in their final moments, the writhing of sorrow that they desired to cause the innocent, and so does it DISPLAY, and PROVE, that I am the God of doing only Good. For as they enact opposites of my will, and of my Spirit, do they claim to rival against us as stronger, or greater. The perpetually ugly and vile can never be without paying homage to me as the creator. They desire to be me, though in no parallel. For I love my children, so they will hate my children. For as there is beside me a spectrum immense of warriors, angels and heavenly beings, do they seek to build up a legion, as an army. For as I give great and abundant life, they seek to destroy any life. They are fatal copyists and the time of their prevail is short. I SHALL LIFT THE MOST BLINDING VEIL OFF, AND EXPOSE ALL.</p>

<p class="WORDOF2" id="A2">If you are struggling, such as starting to believe God is evil, or being swayed by deception and lies of this world, please contact me. I can help you to the true light. It is my gift that in my life, from the most pain and most grief, I can relate to many people and help them to Christ. &#1418; The Bible was not translated, there is faith; no such thing as faiths or many faiths, languages do not come from other languages which came from animal grunts, Jesus Christ is the KING of lucifer; not the kin of. The enemy have it on good authority that this is the devil's world, and that all is the game and dance of filth, that is making death life, and doing absolutely everything. God is The Absolute. Do what the wicked ones have taken from you: Fear no man. Standfast in your understandings, and know of your relationship with The Father. Engage in your monologue and hear back. It's going to be the hardest thing you will ever do in your life, and it will be your entire life, and all you have to do - is the first thing you do everyday, just wakeup</p>
