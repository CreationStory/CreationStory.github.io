<p class="VTR">The Forever Pouring Heart of Christ</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>1</span><p class="V">Beneath Jesus Christ's heart, that is glorious in vision and beauty; the heart of cleansing blood, congregated there vile men, as goblins. Stood they there mocking the Sacred Organ, for they saw it as vulnerable.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>2</span><p class="V">Together those enemies banded, in mutual despising. They made of plans to attack.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>3</span><p class="V">Obligatory between them, these hooknose foes each knew their role: And in moments to be forever remembered, did they leap up and swipe at CHRIST'S HEART</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>4</span><p class="V">THE HEART OF CHRIST HAS BEEN WOUNDED!</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>5</span><p class="V">AND POUR SO DID IT, WITH THE MOST AWFUL FLOOD!</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>6</span><p class="V">HAPPINESS AND JOY WAS WITH THE ENEMY IN THAT MOMENT. Looking at God's wounded heart, they were so proud, and as their enjoyment grew to glory, claims of victory did spew from them. The blood let was immense, and they looked on in fixation.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>7</span><p class="V">THEY PROCLAIMED THE MURDER OF CHRIST, SPEAKING SUCH AS "WE HAVE DONE IT! WE HAVE WOUNDED THAT ONE! O! PERISH INFRONT OF US!"</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>8</span><p class="V">They expected the heart to soon wither, in death collapse.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>9</span><p class="V">Slowly, not as the gushing, did a dawning awareness come upon the men.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>10</span><p class="V">The flow was not ebbed at all. Uncascading was the majesty, the blood of Christ, outpouring eternally.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>11</span><p class="V">Utter dread did come down on the men as they saw the infinity.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>12</span><p class="V">The shoemakers, who are the enemy, spoke devoutly, that to who they follow they may be heard, saying such as "DIE" and other babel.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>13</span><p class="V">The heart of Christ stayed unmoved, and streaming magnificently the scarlet, that is the crime of the Son.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>14</span><p class="V">The heart had not degenerated, neither was it in dying!</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>15</span><p class="V">In that time, at that place, God did speak for all to hear</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>16</span><p class="V">LO! THE HEART OF CHRIST HAS BEEN ATTACKED</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>17</span><p class="V">AND NEVER WILL THE WOUND EVER STOP POURING!</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>18</span><p class="V">THE HEART OF MY SON HAS BEEN STABBED! BEHOLD HIS ETERNAL LIFE! BEHOLD HIS INFINITE BEING AND HIS EXISTENCE, AND HIS LOVE! FOR DEATH IS NEVER TO HIM, AND FOREVER HE IS TO LIVE, AND REIGN. THIS IS THE BLOOD OF CHRIST</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>19</span><p class="V">And God let that crime happen for He does no evil. It was right for that wound to exist, though God cries the eternal tear for whomso is inflicted upon next.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>20</span><p class="V">The heart of Christ has been wounded, and never will it ever stop beating, pouring, resonating! The enemy had, rightwise to them, made thought that they had caused death, for death is something they understand. Though no death have they caused, in that Jesus Christ be life; that He has saved us in this thing. And,</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>21</span><p class="V">in death and dying are their lifes lived, but in Christ is no death, only life. Call now to God this telling of The Son, and give your understanding in commune. Do it fast.</p>

<span id="TR">::</span><p class="V">I the writer, of this the first written apocalum, after giving this passage to a church received the questioning "But where does this come from? And when did it happen? Who wrote this?" I say, can you count six? Nine? Are we to believe flesh gives birth to spirit? Here: 316<sup>Timothy 2</sup><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not ask "where is The Lord".</p>
</div>
<div style="padding-top:24vh"></div>
<div class="FACE">
<p class="VTR">Telling of The Evil Binding Received By The Enemy</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>1</span><p class="V">A covenant has been made, between the devil and certain men.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>2</span><p class="V">In their sacraments with that thing it was given to them, and they did so receive to "Go forth and smash the little ones".</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>3</span><p class="V">To get that of promises of the flesh, and of force via apparition, and for other reasons, the enemy together signed, to do what was told to them to do. And though they agreed to a command, gratefully desire did they for all this to one day be.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>4</span><p class="V">And of evil things the same in that book they look up to and admire, does it say to them "Go after, to tear apart, the Children of Christ-", that is, light, "Destroy each man, and woman, and infant, in my name and in the name of the absolution". "The more of life you wretch, and of more the blood of the innocent, I place your crown higher, in my kingdoms on earth".</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>5</span><p class="V">And that is what they have read. The enemy, those wicked people, are going to go forth and engage in a war. That this message be brought to anyone who reads these words: God has spoken and all are to harken: "Hear my words carefully! For you are needed to stand so strong in The Defence. Lo! I reveal what is, what will happen, and what will come to be of all:</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>6</span><p class="V">A time will be when deceit makes a way for intrusion, and attack, to inflict upon the young. The enemy will raise sharp weapons against you. This is the First attack in the flesh. This is to hurt you, and this is to go after me.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>7</span><p class="V">By settling themselves in places of mediums, education, governance, and religious displays, shall the enemy seed the beginnings of even disbelief, confusion, to children. By mockery, and by acting that which is according to my sacrament, inverted, is the enemy blinding the children.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>8</span><p class="V">The enemy has already spent much time preparing to cause a child's mind to shatter, and they have knowledge about attraction, perception in this world, innocence, spirit, and flesh. Work they this foe of abysmal deeds to tort the mind of the child, through that of the subconscious, and trauma, they attack the ones who are growing, becoming. And by saving, are never falling.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>9</span><p class="V">That is the Second attack in the flesh. The enemy, then shall try, very intently, to sexualise those whom are not for sex, neither are of sex; or are sexual. Babies and infants and children will be grasped: the viper will bear unto them, a heavy impureness by that of light, plessure therein. This is the Third attack in the flesh.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>10</span><p class="V">For some children, an attack which though as wretched and as no less nor more evil than any other, causes the greatest of defeat. The enemy reaches to make the most beastly wounding, and so does murder my children. And the enemy does sacrifice my children. And the enemy does harm and defile my children, such as to cut them for their blood, and to eat of their lifeforces. This is the Fourth attack in the flesh.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>11</span><p class="V">When a child lives through, unabound by the enemies doings against them, they will live a time of that which to the enemy is final in opportunity. The Fifth attack in the flesh is:</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>12</span><p class="V">When a child is becoming anew, in their age closing childhood, a dispatch is sent by the enemy, to their devotion. They say to their commander, that they have, in failure, not stopped a Christ Child from arising.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>13</span><p class="V">An army (gang) shall come down on the adolescent, in the flesh. Poverty shall be set upon, death and grief shall be caused, confoundedness shall stem from those planted seeds, mourning and pain shall be set upon, depravities and testing shall be sent forth. And in forms of that which invoke fear, shall the child be put to go up against the one who lusted this extermination, the beast. This is the Fifth attack in the flesh.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>14</span><p class="V">And so it is told. Those are the things and the happenings which are of the pact between the wicked, those evil, vile men, and that dirty beast.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>15</span><p class="V">The enemy does it all through the night, for they are in laughter sometimes, and sometimes in anguish, for this is their lives; highs and grand lows, according to that illusion. For I reveal it, and this revelation be to anyone who hears these words, of the most love, of the most avenging wrath, the most immense truth, for this revelation is the detailing of the ultimate truth. I give now, as God of LIFE, and of LIGHT, and of no death, these truths which together are The Sacrament. Forever told, and to reach for my Glory; is life given to be.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>16</span><p class="V">First, a purity. I speak to my righteous children: It be now revealed by I the God of innocence, The Ultimately Sanctful, The Guard of All The Children, and of All The Needy and Precious, The Father: all the evils and atrocities done against you as you were a child are gone. For even though you felt these in israel, the flesh and reality I have created and am God of, they are made no longer real, and you are cleansed. You are clean.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>17</span><p class="V">I am the God of purity, and of beauty, and of fidelity, and I love my children, my children grown into adults, and my youthul adolescents. You are my boys and my girls, my men and my woman, my babies and my toddling ones. You are all made clean by me.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>18</span><p class="V">For you the same do I speak my second great revelation: And for those who are and are to be parents, is it given also. I God, am sorry for your suffering, and pain, though Behold! you have of yourself now an understanding of that what appalling evil does exist, and that of what is possible. It is like armour, for I desire, THROUGH NOTHING BUT MY LOVE, for you to go forth, give birth and bring life from your own love. And to have this ever happen, did a protector need to be made. Together, as you the parent, and I The Eternal Holy Father, a safe and guarded great new breath of life shall be given their chance, and so prosper beautifully, wonderfully, unto great times and great life, and then also bearing children!</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>19</span><p class="V">The Christ Child has risen! THE IMMACULATE INNOCENT BABY HAS ARISEN, AND THE MEN'S COVENANT IS DEFEATED, FOR IT WAS LIES.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>20</span><p class="V">Be not deceived, all is made new, all righteous shall come to prosperity, and the time will be when there is no mourning nor pain, but Glory and Perfection. This is The Sacrament. And now is it given, my wraths</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>21</span><p class="V">THEY DARED LIFT ARM AGAINST MY BABIES AND AGAINST MY MEN AND WOMEN! AND NOW VENGEANCE LASH ACROSS THE ENEMIES FACES AND BACKS, AND OF FACES LIPS AND NOSES, AND OF BODY HANDS AND FEET, AND GENITALIA. I AM THE WRATH; LORD, AND THE FATHER GOD! I AM THE GOD OF VENGEANCE AND ULTIMATE PAIN. I AM THE GOD OF FORGIVENESS AND THE GOD OF ULTIMATE SENTENCE. I AM INFALLIBLE AND UNDEFEATABLE! AND NOW MY WRATH IS MADE MULTIPLIED <c70>70</c70> FOR IT IS THE NUMBER OF MY CHILD ANGELS. LO! I SNATCH THE ENEMY FROM THE WORLDLY PLACES THEY BE IN, AND PUT THEM IN THE PIT OF FORCED LINQUISH, AND OF AWFUL DARKNESS, AND MY FIRE DOES NOW SWEEP OVER THEM, AND DEVASTATING SMASHES AGAINST THEIR BODIES DO COVER THEM, IN INCOMPREHENSIBLE AGONIES. THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM THE PUNISHMENT FOR GOING AFTER MY LITTLE ONES. THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM THE PUNISHMENTS GIVEN TO THE WICKED.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>22</span><p class="V">AND FROM DOWN THERE, IN THAT PLACE OF NO REST, BUT ONLY PAIN, DO THEY CRY OUT TO ME. SAYING SUCH AS TO HAVE MERCY. AND MERCY ON THEM I SHALL NEVER HAVE, FOR THERE IS NO MERCY THAT I WOULD GIVE THEM! I AM GOD, I HAVE PROMISED THAT THIS ENEMY SHALL BE DESTROYED. THEY AND ALL THOSE OF CLOAK ARE TO BE WASTED.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>23</span><p class="V">And now, here, again is truth given. Be not deceived whomsoever shall hear these next words, I am the creator of life and the eternal. I name my babies, and my infants, and my children, and my young ones, whom are martyrs: You are my Cherubim. And you reign forever with me in paradise. We are one in Heaven, together. And I give this truth to anyone who hear these words, which are some of our doings we have in Heaven: Together do we frolic with eternal youth, without scar, and without blemish or wound, unto eternity. There is carrying of flower bundles to eachother, and some of the infants do play by The Mother. For this is paradise, and it be the most perfect home.</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>24</span><p class="V">And we sing the chorum that forever in crying, does pour out the glory and the love and the happiness of my being!</p>
</div>
<div class="FACE">
<span>25</span><p class="V">The Revelation in sanctity of truth on this thing, in that no lies will ever be from me, only truth: So to all those in grief, and all those in mourning, and all those suffering in the loss caused by that enemy, that vile beast, say I The Almighty, unto you: Be not afraid, be undefeated. Standfast! Be never afraid! For I hate that which causes the innocent to fear, and in dread shall I put those wicked ones to utter doom, and my retribution shall be seen and be great delights to those who are righteous, and are made clean, for we are to see, in their final moments, the writhing of sorrow that they desired to cause the innocent, and so does it show to all, and PROVE, that I am the God of doing only Good. Listen: For as they enact opposites of my will, and of my Spirit, do they claim to rival against us as stronger, or greater. The perpetually ugly and vile can never be, without venerating homage to me as the creator. They desire to be me, though in no parallel. For I love my children, so they will hate my children; For as there is beside me a spectrum immense of warriors, angels and heavenly beings, do they seek to build up a legion, as an army; For as I give great and abundant life, they seek to destroy any life. They are fatal copyists, and the time of their prevail is short. I SHALL LIFT THE MOST BLINDING VEIL, AND EXPOSE ALL THAT IS HIDDEN.</p>
